# Time Management System

This folder contains time tracking information for the Ville Pajala Hub project. The system uses markdown files to track time spent on different aspects of the project, making it easy to maintain in version control and analyze progress.

## Structure

- **weekly_logs/**: Contains weekly time tracking logs
- **monthly_summaries/**: Contains monthly summaries of time spent
- **time_summary.md**: Overall project time summary
- **templates/**: Contains templates for creating new time tracking entries

## How to Use

1. At the start of each week, create a new weekly log file using the template
2. Record time entries daily, categorizing them by project phase and task type
3. At the end of each week, update the monthly summary
4. At the end of each month, update the overall time summary

## Time Entry Format

Each time entry should include:
- Date
- Start and end time (or duration)
- Project phase (e.g., UX Design, Frontend Development)
- Task category (e.g., Navigation, Blog Templates)
- Description of work done
- Any blockers or challenges encountered

## Integration with Project Management

The time tracking system is designed to work alongside the Project Management Document. When updating time entries, also remember to update task progress in the PMD according to the Documentation Update Policy.

## Analysis

Time data can be analyzed to:
- Identify which aspects of the project are taking more time than estimated
- Track progress against the project timeline
- Provide insights for future project planning
- Document the total effort invested in the project
