# Documentation Update Policy

## Rule Description
After each significant change to the project, the Project Management Document must be updated to reflect the current state, progress, and any adjustments to priorities or timelines.

## When to Apply This Rule
- When completing any task from the project checklist
- When adding new features or components
- When changing project priorities or direction
- When encountering or resolving technical challenges
- Before and after each milestone review

## Update Process
1. Open the Project Management Document at `.documentation/Project_Management_Document.md`
2. Mark completed tasks with `- [x]` instead of `- [ ]`
3. Add any new tasks that have been identified
4. Update timeline estimates if necessary
5. Document any challenges encountered and solutions implemented
6. Note any decisions made that affect the project direction

## Why This Rule Matters
Maintaining up-to-date project documentation ensures:
- Clear visibility into project progress
- Accurate tracking of completed and remaining work
- Preservation of technical decisions and their rationale
- Easier onboarding for any new team members
- A reliable historical record of the project's evolution

## Example Update
```markdown
#### Week 1: Design System & Core Structure
- [x] Create design system with color palette, typography, and spacing
- [x] Implement base Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up project structure and component organization
- [ ] Develop basic responsive layout framework

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Selected typography didn't render well on Windows devices
- **Solution**: Switched to a more cross-platform compatible font family and added fallbacks
```

Remember: The Project Management Document is a living document that should always reflect the current state of the project.
