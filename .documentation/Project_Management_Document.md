# Project Management Document (PMD)

## 1. Project Overview
This document outlines the management approach for Ville Pajala's personal website project, which combines personal branding, portfolio showcase, and business presence. The project follows a **UX-first development approach** with a future-ready architecture using Next.js, Sanity.io, Supabase, and Clerk.

## 2. Development Philosophy
- **UX-First**: User experience design and implementation take priority over backend functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core visual and interactive elements, then add functionality
- **Iterative Development**: Regular review cycles to refine the user experience
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Design decisions consider long-term scalability and maintainability

## 3. Cursor Rule: Documentation Update Policy
> **IMPORTANT**: After each significant change to the project, this Project Management Document must be updated to reflect the current state, progress, and any adjustments to priorities or timelines.

This rule has been formalized in the Cursor rules system:
- Main rules file: [.cursor/rules.md](../.cursor/rules.md)
- Documentation policy: [.cursor/rules/documentation_update_policy.md](../.cursor/rules/documentation_update_policy.md)

The Cursor rules system will help remind us to follow this policy throughout the development process.

### Update Process
1. When completing a task or milestone, mark it as completed in this document `- [x]`
2. If adding new tasks or changing priorities, update the relevant sections
3. Document any challenges encountered and solutions implemented
4. Update timeline estimates if necessary
5. Note any decisions made that affect the project direction

### Documentation Review Checkpoints
- At the beginning of each development session
- After completing any task from the checklist
- When making architectural or design decisions
- Before and after each milestone review
- When encountering or resolving blockers

This rule ensures that the documentation remains a living document that accurately reflects the project's current state and serves as a reliable guide for development.

## 4. Time Management System

To track time spent on the project and analyze progress, a time management system has been implemented in the `.timemanagement` directory. This system helps monitor effort, identify bottlenecks, and maintain accountability throughout the development process.

### Structure and Components
- **Weekly Logs**: Detailed daily time entries categorized by project phase and task type
- **Monthly Summaries**: Aggregated monthly data with analysis of time distribution
- **Project Summary**: Overall project time metrics and insights

### Integration with Project Management
The time management system works in conjunction with this Project Management Document:
1. Time entries should reference tasks from the PMD
2. When updating the PMD, reference relevant time data
3. Timeline adjustments should be reflected in both systems

### How to Use
1. Record time entries in weekly logs using the provided template
2. Update monthly summaries at the end of each week
3. Review the overall time summary monthly to identify trends and make adjustments

For detailed instructions, templates, and examples, see [.timemanagement/README.md](../.timemanagement/README.md).
