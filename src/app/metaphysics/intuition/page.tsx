              Intuition is often misunderstood as mysterious or magical, but contemporary research reveals 
              it as a sophisticated form of cognitionâ€”a rapid, non-conscious processing of information based on 
              experience, pattern recognition, and embodied knowledge. Far from being opposed to rational thinking, 
              intuition complements analytical approaches by providing access to knowledge that may not be 
              immediately available to conscious reasoning.

                  The most effective thinking integrates both analytical and intuitive processes. Rather than 
                  privileging one over the other, the goal is to develop both capacities and learn when each 
                  is most appropriate. Complex problems often benefit from an iterative approach that moves 
                  between intuitive pattern recognition and careful analytical verification.
